# GIS_Small_Python_Projects
Collection of small GIS &amp; Python-based projects

# ⭐ Repository Overview
This repository is a growing collection of small, practical, real-world GIS projects built entirely using Python and open-source geospatial libraries.
Each project is designed to be:

1. Beginner-friendly, yet technically strong

2. Portfolio-ready, showcasing your GIS & Python skills

3. Modular, so each project stands alone

4. Useful for interviews, resumes, GitHub portfolio

5. Educational, with clear code, comments, and explanations

Aligned with industry workflows used in planning, utilities, smart cities, environment, urban analytics, and GeoAI

Whether you're a GIS student, geospatial analyst, Python learner, or an urban planning professional, this repository serves as a practical learning library to strengthen core skills in spatial analysis.

# 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this collection is to:

✔ Build a strong Python + GIS learning portfolio

Projects here help you show recruiters and clients what you can actually build, not just what you know.

✔ Practice real workflows used in industry

Each project uses modern open-source tools like GeoPandas, Rasterio, OSMnx, Folium, RasterStats, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch (for advanced tasks), etc.

✔ Teach GIS concepts through practical examples

Every notebook includes:

--> Clear explanations

--> Step-by-step code

--> GIS theory behind each operation

--> Real datasets

--> Visualization outputs

--> Exportable maps & tables

✔ Create ready-to-use templates for future projects

You can copy any project and adapt it to:

Another city

Another raster

Another vector layer

Another problem (density, accessibility, suitability, risk, etc.)


Inside the folder GIS_Small_Python_Projects, you’ll find a set of individual projects.
Each project includes:

📁 Project Folder
│── 📓 Jupyter/Colab Notebook (full workflow)
│── 📄 README.md (project explanation)
│── 🗂 data/ (download instructions or small sample)
│── 🖼 outputs/maps (PNG maps)
│── 📊 outputs/tables (CSV stats)
│── 🧰 scripts/ (helper Python scripts)


Each project focuses on a single GIS analytical task, such as:

1. Population density mapping

2. Accessibility analysis

3. Raster zonal statistics

5. Urban hotspot mapping

6. Geospatial clustering

7. Road network analysis

8. Elevation & terrain analysis

9. Remote sensing classification

10. Suitability modeling

11. Time-series geospatial analysis

# 🌍 Who Is This Repository For?
This repository is perfect for:

--> GIS Analysts

--> Geospatial Developers

--> Python learners

--> GeoAI enthusiasts

--> Urban planners

--> Remote sensing students

--> Data science professionals entering GIS

--> Anyone preparing for GIS interviews

Each project is small, but impactful — ideal for showing real geospatial problem-solving skills.

# 🚀 How to Use This Repository

You can:

1. Open any project folder

2. Read the README

3. Open the notebook

4. Run it in Google Colab or locally

5. View the generated maps/tables

6. Modify the AOI or dataset to create new variations

7. Use the workflow in your own portfolio or job interviews
